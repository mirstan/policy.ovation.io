<p>Ovation works with Subcontractors to assure restriction of physical access to systems used as part of the Ovation Ovation Platform. Ovation and its Subcontractors control access to the physical buildings/facilities that house these systems/applications, or in which Ovation workforce members operate, in accordance to the HIPAA Security Rule 164.310 and its implementation specifications. Physical Access to all of Ovation facilities is limited to only those authorized in this policy. In an effort to safeguard ePHi from unauthorized access, tampering, and theft, access is allowed to areas only to those persons authorized to be in them and with escorts for unauthorized persons. All workforce members are responsible for reporting an incident of unauthorized visitor and/or unauthorized access to Ovation’s facility.</p>
<p>Of note, Ovation does not have ready access to ePHI as it provides cloud-based, compliant applications to covered entities and business associates. Ovation does not physically house any systems used by its Platform in Ovation facilities. Physical security of our Platform servers is outlined <a href="http://broadcast.rackspace.com/downloads/pdfs/RackspaceSecurityApproach.pdf">here</a>.</p>
