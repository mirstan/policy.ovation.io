<h2 id="password-management">Password Management</h2>
<ul>
<li>User IDs and passwords are used to control access to Ovation systems and may not be disclosed to anyone for any reason.</li>
<li>Users may not allow anyone, for any reason, to have access to any information system using another user’s unique user ID and password.</li>
<li>On all production systems and application in the Ovation environment, password configurations are set to require that passwords are a minimum of 8 character length, 90 day password expiration, account lockout after 5 invalid attempts, and account lockout after 15 minutes of inactivity.</li>
<li>All system and application passwords are hashed by concatenating the user's password and a random 256-bit salt value, generated on a per-user basis, and then applying SHA-256 to the value to create a password hash. The password hash and the salt are then stored in the backend database and are used for password validation on future user authentication attempts.* Each information system automatically requires users to change passwords at a pre-determined interval as determined by the organization, based on the criticality and sensitivity of the ePHI contained within the network, system, application, and/or database.</li>
<li>Passwords are inactivated immediately upon an employee’s termination (refer to the termination procedures in this policy).</li>
<li>All default system, application, and Partner passwords are changed before deployment to production.</li>
<li>All passwords used in configuration scripts are secured and encrypted.</li>
<li>If a user believes their user ID has been compromised, they are required to immediately report the incident to the Security Office.</li>
